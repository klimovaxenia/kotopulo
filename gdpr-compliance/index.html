<h2>ON WHAT BASIS DO WE PROCESS YOUR DATA</h2>
<p>We will only use and process the data you provide to us where we have a lawful basis for doing so.</p>

<h2>COOKIES</h2>
<p>Like most websites, our website uses cookies to capture certain data about its use and its users to improve the functionality of our website and your experience when using it. Cookies may store preferences and other data about your use of our website and we use this data to improve your experience of our website by making it personalised to you.</p>

<h2>IP ADDRESSES</h2>
<p>When you visit our website our server will temporarily record your IP address (similar to a phone number, it is a unique number that allows your computer or device to communicate via the internet). It allows us to identify your country of origin whilst you are navigating our website, so we can direct you to the most suitable regional pages of our website.

All our employees and any third parties we engage to process your data are obliged to respect the confidentiality of your data.</p>

<p>However, the internet is not a secure environment and we cannot therefore guarantee total security of any data transmitted to our website. Whilst we utilise the latest virus protection software, we cannot guarantee our website is free of computer viruses or other harmful applications so such transmission is at your own risk.</p>

<h2>ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
<p>You are entitled to view the personal data we hold about you and request that we amend it or delete it, subject to some exceptions. You also have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your data or to object to that processing. Please email your request to our data protection officer, whose contact details are in the Contact Us section below.</p>

<p>Please note we may require further data from you in order to verify your identity before disclosing, amending or deleting any of your data.</p>

<p>In most cases, we will deal with your requests free of charge and within one month of receipt of your request. However, there are exceptions that may allow us to charge a reasonable fee to cover our administration costs and/or extended the time period for dealing with your request to two months from receipt of your request, such as where your request is complex or repetitive. If an exception applies, we will keep you informed.</p>

<p>We will never charge you to change your marketing preferences or unsubscribe to our marketing communications.</p>
